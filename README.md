# Churn_prediction

Goal of this project is to implement machine learning model to predict customer churn of telecom company.

Out of 50 features present in dataset, after normalizing and cleaning data, I've selected using RandomForestClassifier with ensemble learning and SMOTEE technique as well.

I tries basic Custom ensemble using Random froest,Decision tree and SVC.

I got best value form Hyper prameter tunes SMOTEE Random Forest.

Used 80/20 training and testing data for model development.
